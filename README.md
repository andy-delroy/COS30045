For the project, I used GitHub Copilot to scaffold my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure more quickly. 
It suggested boilerplate code for the navigation and footer which are repetitive in all three pages. 
I reviewed and edited the suggestions to make sure they matched the task requirements and were accessible. 
Overall, Copilot sped up repetitive coding but I still had to understand, adapt, and debug the code myself; it was an assistant, not a replacement for my own work.
